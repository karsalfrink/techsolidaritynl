        <h4><a href="/">Tech Solidarity NL</a> meetup #14</h4>

        <h5>Our next meetup happens Monday, August 6 at <a href="https://www.sensorlab.nl">Sensor Lab</a> from 17:00&#8211;21:00 (doors open 16:30) and is about <strong>Practicing Value Sensitive Design</strong>.</h5>

        <p>Summer is near! We don‘t want to break our two-month rhythm so our next get-together happens Monday, August 6. For those that are still in the country it is probably the only event you are going to visit!</p>
        
        <p>What are our plans? We thought we would do a mini summer camp on the topic we discussed in various earlier editions: How to bring ethics into your process. Some time ago we had a <a href="https://techsolidarity.nl/meetup-10.html">session on value sensitive design</a> (VSD) and at our <a href="https://techsolidarity.nl/meetup-13.html">last meetup</a> it came up as well in the context of machine learning. The conclusion was that it is a promising framework, so we would like to make it more practical. This session we will take a bit more time to dive deeper and especially take the opportunity to work together towards a tangible outcome.</p>

        <p>What can VSD deliver? We'll find out by discussing and implementing VSD in a couple of cases in different groups. After that we'll reflect and discuss what kind of tooling is necessary to make this VSD approach practical for designers and programmers. Ideally, we end up with a sketch of the toolkit we need, one that we think can be used by everyone afterwards.</p>

        <p>We hope we have a small group of smart people. We will of course prepare the sessions and present the state of VSD so that everyone is on the same page (whether or not you attended the previous session). Roughly the program will be:
        <ul>
          <li>17:00 welcome and introductions<br></li>
          <li>17:15 introduction to VSD</li>
          <li>17:45 dividing the groups, discussing the quest for the evening</li>
          <li>18:45 bring in some food</li>
          <li>19:00 presenting the thought/designs/strategies to the other groups</li>
          <li>19:30 detail the toolkit sketch</li>
          <li>20:30 wrap-up, plans for next steps</li>
          <li>21:00 end and drinks</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>We propose to work together in a shared space like a Risepad or a wiki to store all the findings and thoughts. We will look into possible tools but if you join and have specific ideas, please contact us. And if you have your own case, where ethical aspects play(ed) a role or one with various stakeholders within and outside of the organization, please let us know!</p>
