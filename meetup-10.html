          <h5>Our next meetup happens Monday, December 11 at <a href="https://www.info.nl">Info.nl</a> from 16:00-18:00 (doors open 15:30) and will be about <a href="http://vsdesign.org">value sensitive design</a>. Read on below for details.</h5>

          <p>At our own past meetups and in technology discourse at large it is often said designers and programmers should be ethical, do no harm, and so on. But tech workers aren’t the only ones deciding about what values are embedded in the products and services they help build. Furthermore, it is often assumed there is some optimal solution to a project's ethical issues when in fact every choice involves trade-offs. As tech workers, we desperately need effective and realistic methods for putting ethical values at the center of our projects.</p> 

          <p>The good news is, there is a long history of research into this topic in design and computer science. But to date not much of it has found its way into the mainstream design and development conversation. At the next meetup, we are going to dive into one promising theory and method called <a href="http://vsdesign.org">value sensitive design</a>. We’ll kick off with a short lecture on what VSD is, why it was developed, and how it works. Then we’ll work among ourselves to see how we can apply the ideas from VSD in our own practice today.</p> 

          <p>We’ll meet at <a href="https://www.info.nl">Info.nl</a> in Amsterdam on Monday, December 11. We will start at 16:00 and wrap up around 18:00. (Doors open 15:30.)</p> 

          <p>To RSVP, send an email to <a href='mailto&#58;&#105;&#110;f%6F&#64;te%63%&#54;&#56;solid&#97;&#37;72&#37;69&#37;74&#121;&#46;%6El'>info&#64;&#116;&#101;chsoli&#100;ari&#116;y&#46;n&#108;</a>. Hope to see you there!</p>
